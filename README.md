This project is becoming an all-in-one banking system, which includes an API for points-of-sale or websites to charge fictional accounts with attached credit/debit cards.
I'm building this as a fun way to demonstrate my skills with relational databases, Spring framework and REST APIs. It will allow accounts to be established, validated, and transacted with
via the API. 

In the future, this project might include code for a POS that will interact with the API.
